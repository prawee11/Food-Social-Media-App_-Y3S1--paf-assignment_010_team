#### Brief Description of your Solution - 

   As the group project for the module Programming applications and Frameworks (IT3030), we were required to develop a social media platform that satisfies the CRUD functions.The scenario that our project got was to develop a platform for food and beverage reviewers that will enable them to share their food and dining experiences. The platform is quite similar to existing social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook.
  We are going to make this app with the ability to create posts that can be uploaded with 1-4 photos including a description, this is the Create function. The update function will include the ability for the post to be updated or edited by the user as needed. The user will also have the ability to delete the posts if the need be.And also CLient Can share others post also with caption they can update and delete shared post also. 
The client’s needs that has to be met can be categorized into the main CRUD functions as Create, Update, Read and Delete. The User will have the ability to create a user account and view the posts uploaded by them and to view other users on the platform by searching for them. They will also have the ability to follow other users and leave reactions and comments on others posts as well, the comments can be edited or removed by the user if needed. Like in many other social media platforms the author will have the right to edit or delete the comments and reactions left by other users. The owner will be notified when someone comments or reacts on their post, as the client suggests that the users will be from non-technical backgrounds the platform will be easy and user friendly to use. The Platform will be secured using OAuth based authentication system. The platform will use REST API that will be used in both web application and mobile application. 
The 4 CRUD functions will be divided between the 4 members of the group as follows.
